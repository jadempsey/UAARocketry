Hi. I\textquotesingle{}m a starter theme called {\ttfamily \+\_\+s}, or {\ttfamily underscores}, if you like. I\textquotesingle{}m a theme meant for hacking so don\textquotesingle{}t use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, Word\+Press theme out there. That\textquotesingle{}s what I\textquotesingle{}m here for.

My ultra-\/minimal C\+S\+S might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you\textquotesingle{}re designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you\textquotesingle{}ll find here\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A just right amount of lean, well-\/commented, modern, H\+T\+M\+L5 templates.
\item A helpful 404 template.
\item A sample custom header implementation in {\ttfamily inc/custom-\/header.\+php} that can be activated by uncommenting one line in {\ttfamily functions.\+php} and adding the code snippet found in the comments of {\ttfamily inc/custom-\/header.\+php} to your {\ttfamily header.\+php} template.
\item Custom template tags in {\ttfamily inc/template-\/tags.\+php} that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
\item Some small tweaks in {\ttfamily inc/extras.\+php} that can improve your theming experience.
\item A script at {\ttfamily js/navigation.\+js} that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for C\+S\+S artistry. It\textquotesingle{}s enqueued in {\ttfamily functions.\+php}.
\item 2 sample C\+S\+S layouts in {\ttfamily layouts/} for a sidebar on either side of your content.
\item Smartly organized starter C\+S\+S in {\ttfamily style.\+css} that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
\item Licensed under G\+P\+Lv2 or later. \+:) Use it to make something cool.

\subsection*{Getting Started }

If you want to keep it simple, head over to \href{http://underscores.me}{\tt http\+://underscores.\+me} and generate your {\ttfamily \+\_\+s} based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the \char`\"{}\+Generate\char`\"{} button, and you get your ready-\/to-\/awesomize starter theme.

If you want to set things up manually, download {\ttfamily \+\_\+s} from Git\+Hub. The first thing you want to do is copy the {\ttfamily \+\_\+s} directory and change the name to something else (like, say, {\ttfamily megatherium}), and then you\textquotesingle{}ll need to do a five-\/step find and replace on the name in all the templates.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Search for `\textquotesingle{}{\itshape s\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.}}
\item {\itshape {\ttfamily Search for}\+\_\+s}{\ttfamily to capture all the function names.}
\item {\ttfamily Search for}Text Domain\+: \+\_\+s` in style.\+css.
\item Search for {\ttfamily ~\+\_\+s} (with a space before it) to capture Doc\+Blocks.
\item Search for {\ttfamily \+\_\+s-\/} to capture prefixed handles.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

O\+R


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Search for\+: `\textquotesingle{}{\itshape s\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily and replace with\+:}\textquotesingle{}megatherium\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily }}
\item {\itshape {\ttfamily Search for\+:}\+\_\+s}{\ttfamily and replace with\+:}megatherium\+\_\+{\ttfamily }
\item {\ttfamily Search for\+:}Text Domain\+: \+\_\+s{\ttfamily and replace with\+:}Text Domain\+: megatherium` in style.\+css.
\item Search for\+: {\ttfamily ~\+\_\+s} and replace with\+: {\ttfamily ~Megatherium}
\item Search for\+: {\ttfamily \+\_\+s-\/} and replace with\+: {\ttfamily megatherium-\/}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Then, update the stylesheet header in {\ttfamily style.\+css} and the links in {\ttfamily footer.\+php} with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you\textquotesingle{}re ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do\+: make an awesome Word\+Press theme. \+:)

Good luck!
